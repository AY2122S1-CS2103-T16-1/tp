## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `touch -n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `touch -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `-n NAME [-t TAG]` can be used as `-n John Doe -t friend` or as `-n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-t TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `-t friend`, `-t friend -t family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-p 12341234 -p 56785678`, only `-p 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Flags such as `-contacts` and `-folders` are part of the command word and should be placed adjacent to the main command word
